Gameboy Zero 3.5" Theme for Emulation Station

This theme pulls heavily from the Spare and SimpleBigArt themes.  It is optimized for resolutions up to 640x480 on small 4:3 screens (like the 3.5" screens commonly used in Gameboy Zero builds).  It also works on 16:9 screens but you will notice that the background art is stretched when viewing in this aspect.
